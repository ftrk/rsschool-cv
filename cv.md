## About Me

Programming has been a hobby for me for the past few years, but recently I decided to turn my hobby into a source of income.
I love challenging tasks and puzzles, and I enjoy solving them. My best qualities are revealed when I work in a relaxed atmosphere, relying on my skills, competence and flair. In addition, I am always open to communication with colleagues both regarding work and other various topics, ranging from weather to quantum physics.
